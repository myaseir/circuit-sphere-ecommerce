## Introduction

Servo motors are the muscles of robotics. Unlike normal DC motors that spin continuously, a **Servo Motor** can rotate to a specific angle (usually 0 to 180 degrees). This makes them perfect for:
* Robotic Arms
* RC Plane rudders
* Automatic Door locks
* Camera gimbals

In this guide, we will learn how to control them using an Arduino Uno.

## Choosing Your Motor
Which one do you need?
1.  [**SG90 Micro Servo (Plastic Gear)**](/product/sg90-servo): Small, cheap, and lightweight. Perfect for small sensors or light mechanisms.
2.  [**MG995 Metal Gear Servo**](/product/mg995-servo): Heavy-duty, high torque (10kg/cm). Best for robotic arms and walking robots.

## Wiring Diagram
Servos usually have 3 wires. Connecting them wrong can damage your board, so be careful!



* **Brown or Black Wire:** Connect to **GND** (Ground).
* **Red Wire:** Connect to **5V**.
* **Orange or Yellow Wire:** Connect to **Digital Pin 9** (PWM).

> **Warning for MG995 Users:** The Arduino 5V pin can handle one small SG90. But if you are using the big **MG995** or multiple servos, you MUST use an external battery (like a [Lipo Battery](/product/lipo-battery)) to power the motors. Just remember to connect the battery GND to Arduino GND.

## The Code
Arduino makes controlling servos incredibly easy with the `<Servo.h>` library. Copy this code into your Arduino IDE:

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myServo;  // Create a servo object to control the motor

void setup() {
  myServo.attach(9);  // Attaches the servo on Pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  // Sweep from 0 to 180 degrees
  for (int pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { 
    myServo.write(pos);              // Tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // Wait 15ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
  
  // Sweep back from 180 to 0 degrees
  for (int pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { 
    myServo.write(pos);              
    delay(15);                       
  }
}
