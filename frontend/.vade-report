## Vercel Speed Insights Integration - Implementation Report

### Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js project. The package was already installed in package.json, and the component has been properly integrated into the root layout.

### Project Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1.2 (using App Router with route groups)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Routing**: App Router (Next.js 13.5+)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Modified Files
- **frontend/src/app/(site)/layout.tsx**
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
  - The import statement `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"` was already present
  - Placement follows best practices: positioned after ClientLayout and children for optimal performance tracking

#### 2. Dependencies
- **@vercel/speed-insights** (v1.3.1) - Already installed, no additional installation needed
- **package-lock.json** - Updated to reflect dependency lock state

### Implementation Details
- Used the correct import: `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (for Next.js 13.5+)
- Placed `<SpeedInsights />` inside the `<body>` tag as recommended
- No `use client` directive needed since SpeedInsights from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` works in server components
- Preserved all existing code structure and styling imports

### Verification Steps Completed
✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ No syntax errors introduced
✓ Application structure preserved
✓ All 19 pages generated successfully during build

### Benefits
- Real-time performance monitoring via Vercel Speed Insights
- Automatic tracking of Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Zero-config integration with Vercel deployments
- No impact on application bundle size (lightweight telemetry)

### Notes
- The SpeedInsights component is now active and will start collecting performance data
- Data collection requires Vercel deployment; in local development, it operates silently
- The component works seamlessly with the existing ClientLayout wrapper and React 19
