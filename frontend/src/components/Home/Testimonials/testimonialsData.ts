    review: `Finally, a store in Pakistan that packs components properly. Usually, when I order sensors online, the pins arrive bent. Glacia Labs sent everything in anti-static bags and bubble wrap. Highly appreciate the care.`,

    review: `Genuine components. I checked the voltage regulators and capacitors under a microscope, and they are not cheap knock-offs. For professional prototyping, this is now my go-to vendor in Pakistan.`,
